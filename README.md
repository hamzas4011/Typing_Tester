# ✨ Typing Tester 🎯

**Typing Tester** is a Python-based application designed to measure typing speed and accuracy. This project was developed as part of a **home exam** for the course **ACIT4420: Problem-solving with Scripting** in the **Applied Computer and Information Technology** master's program at **Oslo Metropolitan University**.

The application leverages **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, utilizing **classes and methods** to organize the functionality into modular and reusable components. It includes accessibility features, such as a **text-to-speech (TTS)** function powered by the `pyttsx3` library, and integrates **Python APIs** for enhanced text processing and randomization.

Real-time performance analysis is provided, including detailed metrics for typing accuracy and speed, with visual results generated using **matplotlib**. The project is designed with accessibility and user experience in mind, offering options to adjust difficulty levels, track errors, and visualize performance data effectively.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Typing Speed and Accuracy Test:**
  - Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
  - Select from 1 to 10 typing examples in a session.
  - Mistake tracking with highlighted errors for better feedback.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Accessibility Features:**
  - Includes a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** option to read the text aloud, improving accessibility for users with visual impairments.

- 📊 **Performance Metrics:**
  - Displays results, including accuracy, time per text, and average metrics.
  - Visual performance charts are generated using `matplotlib`.

- 🔗 **Modular Codebase:**
  - Uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** to separate logic into reusable and maintainable components.
