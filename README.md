# ✨ Typing Tester

**Typing Tester** is a Python-based application designed to measure typing speed and accuracy. This project was developed as part of a **home exam** for the course **ACIT4420: Problem-solving with Scripting** in the **Applied Computer and Information Technology** master's program at **Oslo Metropolitan University**.

The application leverages **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, utilizing **classes and methods** to organize the functionality into modular and reusable components. It includes **accessibility features**, such as a **text-to-speech (TTS)** function and red error indicators to assist users with cognitive disabilities. The project also integrates **Python APIs** for enhanced text processing and randomization.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Typing Speed and Accuracy Test:**
  - Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
  - Select from 1 to 10 typing examples in a session.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Accessibility Features:**
  - Includes a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** option to read the text aloud, improving usability for users with visual impairments.
  - Features **red error indicators** for immediate feedback, designed to assist individuals who may benefit from clear and intuitive visual cues to identify typing mistakes.

- 📊 **Performance Metrics:**
  - Displays results, including accuracy, time per text, and average metrics.
  - Visual performance charts are generated using `matplotlib`.

- 🔗 **Modular Codebase:**
  - Uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** to separate logic into reusable and maintainable components.
